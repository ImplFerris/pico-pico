# GOT Buzzer?

We are going to play the Game of Thrones (GOT) background music (BGM) on the buzzer, thanks to the awesome [arduino-songs](https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs) repository. It also has other bgms.

If you're unsure about musical notes and sheet music, feel free to check out the quick theory I've provideded [here](./music-theory.md).

I've splitted the code into rust module(you can do it in single file as we have done so far): [`music`](./music-module.md), [`got`](./got-module.md).
