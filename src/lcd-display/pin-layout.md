## Pin Layout

The LCD has a total of 16 pins for the parallel interface.

        - I used two 1k resistors instead, which was sufficient for this exercise.

### Contrast Adjustment
The V<sub>o</sub> pin  controls the contrast of the LCD. 

According to the datasheet of the [LCD1602A](https://www.openhacks.com/uploadsproductos/eone-1602a1.pdf), the **Vo** pin controls the contrast of the LCD by adjusting the operating voltage for the LCD, which is the difference between the power supply for the logic (**VDD**) and the contrast control pin (**Vo**). When **Vo** is closer to ground, the voltage difference (**VDD - Vo**) is larger, resulting in a higher contrast, making the text on the screen more distinct and readable. When **Vo** is closer to **VDD**, the voltage difference decreases, resulting in a lower contrast, causing the text to appear faded or less visible.

You can use the potentiometer to adjust the contrast on the fly. You have to connect the middle pin of the potentiometer to Vo, and the other two pins to VCC and Ground.

You can also use resistors to adjust the contrast, which is what I did. You need to adjust the contrast one way or another. The first time I ran the program, I couldn't see the text clearly. I placed two 1k resistors(when I added only one 1k resistor, it didn't look that great) between Ground and the Vo, and then the text became visible.

 
### Register Select Pin (RS)
The Register Select (RS) pin determines whether the LCD is in command mode or data mode. 

When it is in Low(RS = 0), the LCD is in command mode, where the input is interpreted as a command, such as clearing the display or setting the cursor position (e.g., sending a command to clear the display). 

When it is in High(RS = 1), the LCD is in data mode, where the input is interpreted as data to be displayed on the screen (e.g., sending text to display).


### Enable Pin (E)
It is used to control when data is transferred to the LCD display. The enable pin is typically kept low (E=0) but is set high (E=1) for a specific period of time to initiate a data transfer, and then returned to low.. The data is latched into the LCD on the transition from high to low.
