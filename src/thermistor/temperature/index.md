# Temperature on OLED

In this section, we will measure the temperature in your room and display it on the OLED screen.


## Hardware Requirments

- An OLED display: (0.96 Inch I2C/IIC 4-Pin, 128x64 resolution, SSD1306 chip)
- Jumper wires
- NTC 103 Thermistor: 10K OHM, 5mm epoxy coated disc
- 10kÎ© Resistor: Used with the thermistor to form a voltage divider 

## Circuit to connect OLED, Thermistor with Raspberry Pi Pico

<img style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="pico2" src="../images/thermistor-pico-oled-circuit.jpg"/>

1. **One side of the Thermistor** is connected to **AGND** (Analog Ground).
2. The **other side of the Thermistor** is connected to **GPIO26 (ADC0)**, which is the analog input pin of the pico2
3. A **resistor** is connected in series with the Thermistor to create a voltage divider between the Thermistor and **ADC_VREF** (the reference voltage for the ADC).

<span style="color:orange">Note:</span> In this example, one side of the thermistor is connected to ground, as shown. If you've connected it to the power supply instead, you'll need to use the alternate formula mentioned earlier.
