# Pico Pico - Intro

This book is an informal collection of what I explore, tinker with, and learn along the way. The content isn't meant to be professional; Just raw documentation of my journey.

## Meet the hardware  - Pico 2
We will be using the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (RP2350 chip).  It features the new RP2350 chip with dual-core flexibilityâ€”offering Arm Cortex-M33 cores and optional RISC-V Hazard3 cores. You can operate it as the standard ARM core or switch to the RISC-V architecture.  You find more details from the [official website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/).
