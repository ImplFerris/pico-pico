# Pico Pico - Intro

In this book, we use the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and program it in Rust to explore various exciting projects. You'll work on exercises like dimming an LED, controlling a servo motor, measuring distance with a sonic sensor, displaying the Ferris (ðŸ¦€) image on an OLED display, using RFID Reader, playing songs on a buzzer, turning on an LED when the room light is off, measuring temperature, and much more.

## Meet the hardware - Pico 2

We will be using the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (RP2350 chip). It features the new RP2350 chip with dual-core flexibility;offering Arm Cortex-M33 cores and optional RISC-V Hazard3 cores. You can operate it as the standard ARM core or switch to the RISC-V architecture. You find more details from the [official website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/).
