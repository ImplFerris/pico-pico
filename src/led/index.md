# Dimming LED

In this section, we will learn how to create a dimming effect(i.e. reducing and increasing the brightness) for an LED using the Raspberry Pi Pico 2. First, we will dim the onboard LED, which is connected to GPIO pin 25 (based on the datasheet). 

To make it dim, we use a technique called PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). You can refer to the intro to the PWM section [here](../core-concepts/pwm/index.md).

We will gradually increment the PWM's duty cycle to increase the brightness, then we gradually decrement the PWM duty cycle to  reduce the brightness of the LED. This effectively creates the dimming LED effect. 


## The Eye
"
Come in close... Closer... 

Because the more you think you see... The easier itâ€™ll be to fool you... 

Because, what is seeing?.... You're looking but what you're really doing is filtering, interpreting, searching for meaning...
"

Now, here's the cool part: when this switching happens super quickly, our eyes can't keep up. Instead of seeing the blinking, it just looks like the brightness changes! The longer the LED stays ON, the brighter it seems, and the shorter it's ON, the dimmer it looks. It's like tricking your brain into thinking the LED is smoothly dimming or brightening. PWM: the magician of electronics!
