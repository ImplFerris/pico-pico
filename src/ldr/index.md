## LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)

In this section, we will use an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) with the Raspberry Pi Pico 2. An LDR changes its resistance based on the amount of light falling on it. The brighter the light, the lower the resistance, and the dimmer the light, the higher the resistance. This makes it ideal for applications like light sensing, automatic lighting, or monitoring ambient light levels.

## Components Needed:
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- Resistor (typically 10kÎ©); needed to create voltage divider
- Jumper wires (as usual)
